# Ruby $ Blackjack $
A blackjack game for the terminal, written in Ruby.

## Step 1
Take a look at the existing code. Most of it has been written for you. A few methods remain that need to be filled in. Make sure to also run the application to see visually how it looks so far.

No new methods are necessary, and the only remaining methods that need to be filled in are commented in the controller.

You will need to call methods in the view and models as appropriate to complete the controller methods. Make sure to thoroughly familiarize yourself with all that code.

## Step 2
As a stretch challenge, try implementing Aces high and low functionality and any other additions you would like.

Feel free to have fun and change any of the wording in the views to something more to your liking.
